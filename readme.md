# Sharkie

## Gameplay
In this game, you will play a shark called Sharkie and face various enemies: puffer fish, jellyfish, and an orca.
Each enemy type is susceptible to a different attack. The puffer fish are most affected by slaps but can also be hurt by bubbles.
Jellyfish can only be defeated using bubbles. The final boss (orca) can only be defeated by using poisoned bubbles.
To blow poisoned bubbles, you will need to collect poison bottles first.
There are three levels, increasing in difficulty. If you lose, you can play the same level again.
If you manage to beat level 3, you can start from the beginning.

Have fun playing!
